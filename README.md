# supplementary material regarding the article entitled "DMI Influence on the Integration, Leakage and Threshold Property of Domain Wall based Neurons".

In particular:

1. The folder *DW_Leaking_40nmTrack_DMI0d1em3* contains some material about the simulation of the Leaking of the DW in the 40 nm wide track when the DMI coefficient is 0.1x10^-3 mJ/m^2:
	+ the .mx3 script used to run the simulation in Mumax;
	+ the plots of the Demagnetization, Anisotropy, Exchange and Total energies;
	+ a gif of the movement of the DW along the track. Each second corresponds to 1 ns of the simulation. 

2. The folder *LIFNeuron_DMI0d1em3_CurrentPulse_On8ns_Off40ns* contains some material about the simulation of the response to current pulses of the LIF neuron, for a DMI coefficient of 0.1x10^-3 mJ/m^2 and current pulses of 7e11 A/m^2:
	+ the .mx3 script used to run the simulation in Mumax;
	+ a gif of the movement of the DW along the track. Each second corresponds to 1 ns of the simulation.

2. The folder *VCMA_barrier* contains the .mx3 sample script used to run the simulation. Moreover, some extracted results are reported.
