In this folder you will find some supplementary material regarding the article
"DMI Influence on the Integration, Leakage and Threshold Property of Domain Wall based Neurons".
In particular:

	- The folder "DW_Leaking_40nmTrack_DMI0d1em3" contains some material about the simulation
	  of the Leaking of the DW in the 40 nm wide track when the DMI coefficient is 0.1x10^-3 mJ/m^2:
		1) the .mx3 script used to run the simulation in Mumax;
		2) the plots of the Demagnetization, Anisotropy, Exchange and Total energies;
		3) A gif of the movement of the DW along the track. Each second corresponds to
		   1 ns of the simulation. 

	- The folder "LIFNeuron_DMI0d1em3_CurrentPulse_On8ns_Off40ns" contains some material about
	  the simulation of the response to current pulses of the LIF neuron, for a DMI coefficient of
	  0.1x10^-3 mJ/m^2 and current pulses of 7e11 A/m^2:
		1) the .mx3 script used to run the simulation in Mumax;
		2) A gif of the movement of the DW along the track. Each second corresponds to
		   1 ns of the simulation.
